#### About this Repository
This repository contains a repository of templates that have been used to test 
some of the newer features in OSP 16. Each top level directory represent
their individual set of templates to support the deployment scenario.

These are some of the interesting deployment scenarios covered by these
templates:
- Deploying Multiple Overclouds from a Single Overcloud
- Splitting the Overcloud deployment by using Multiple Stacks

Additional information for each deployment template set can be found in the
README.md for each deployment scenario.



#### Important Notes
These templates were tested on RHOSP 16.0.2 where this Undercloud feature is offered as a tech preview, however full support
for multi-stack and multi overcloud deployments are expected on RHOSP 16.1.
